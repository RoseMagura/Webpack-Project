#Natural Language Processing API

##Introduction

This project uses the Aylien API sentiment feature to analyze the tone
of a news article that the user can provide through a text field in the web
page

##How to Run

1. Run webpack and side server (npm run start in one node.js console and
  npm run build-dev or build-prod in another)
2. Enter in the article url on the webpage input field
3. Use submit button
4. See the dynamic display update with information about the polarity and
polarity constant.

Note: Subjectivity analysis is not available for long documents like articles,
so this app just shows the polarity.
